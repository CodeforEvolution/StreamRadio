name        StreamRadio
version     $VERSION
summary     "Find and play internet radio stations"
description "Start the application. Run a search for a radio station name. If you found one you like, add it to the main list. There you can play it, visit its homepage or change the station information.
Searches use Radio Network, a service that offers a network API to its database (http://www.radio-browser.info). 
Stations including all their attributes are saved as Shoutcast playlist files in ~/settings/Stations so they are available for other apps. 

Please report back any bugs at https://github.com/HaikuArchives/StreamRadio/issues.
